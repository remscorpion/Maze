     * Hint:
     *      1.  Can you scan the file and print it at the same time?
     *      2.  If the answer of 1 is yes, great follow your idea.
     *          If the answer is no, find a way to storage the data first.
     *      3.  How to scan the file?
     *      4.  How to storage the data?
     *      5.  How to print out the data? Is there a way that you can separate this step
     *          to some sub-step? (Break down the big problem into multiple small problems)
     *      6.  After answer these question, start to think about what kind of method (function) you
     *          need to write. (Like we did in the class)
     *      7.  Fill up your functions ans test them
     *      8.  When your methods pass the tests, put them into one piece (put into main)
     *      9.  Test again. Get something strange? Find the problem and keep testing!
     *      10. When you can print out the  first file, try the second one
     *      11. If something wrong, fix it. If you can print out both of them, congratulations!
